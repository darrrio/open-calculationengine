# Contributing to OpenBilling

First off, thank you for considering contributing to OpenBilling. It's people like you that make OpenBilling such a great tool.

## Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, make sure to open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/darrrio/open-billing-dotnet/issues/new) if one does not already exist. 

## Fork & create a branch

If this is something you think you can fix, then [fork OpenBilling](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) and create a branch with a descriptive name.

A good branch name would be (where issue #325 is the ticket you're working on):

```bash
git checkout -b 325-add-japanese-localisation
```
## Get the test suite running
Make sure you're testing the changes before pushing it.

## Make the change
Do the changes in your branch. When you're done with your changes, make sure the application is working as expected and create a pull request.

## Create a Pull Request
At this point, you should switch back to your main branch and make sure it's up to date with OpenBilling's main branch:

Then update your feature branch from your local copy of main, and push it!

Then create a pull request on GitHub.

And that's it! You're done.
